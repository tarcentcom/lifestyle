**Picture as a pro: Rory Gardiner Travel Photographer Tips**

Travel is a privilege that cannot be taken for granted. We used to pack our suitcases and leave to catch the present moment against the background of beautiful sights or to miss it by constantly clicking the shutter. Photographer Rory Gardiner shared his tips for creating perfect shots and talked about places to visit when you can.

**Select the right time**

"Try to shoot at the beginning or end of the day," Gardiner advises, adding that "at this time the light is more interesting, offers different shades and a wide range of colors. As for travel, Gardiner recommends Japan to those who love adventure in the bustling city along with the quiet tranquility of island life.

"Obviously, I'm obsessed with photographing huge pulsating megacities, and Tokyo is the pinnacle of it," Gardiner says. "Along with observation decks and easily accessible viewing points, you can photograph the city from above for weeks," he continues. The photographer recommends finding out which hotels have public bars on the rooftops so you can admire the city from above.

"On Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaido falls up to 16 meters of snow per year. All winter, the island is covered in pure white snow, allowing you to shoot minimalistic landscapes wherever you go," says the photographer.

**Don't dwell on equipment**

"The best camera you have is the one you have," says Gardiner. - The availability of special equipment is not very helpful if it is not with you at the right time. Don't be afraid to use your phone or compact camera, these days they can offer amazing results! When traveling locally, choose locations with spacious landscapes to practice landscape photography in natural light.

**Camera doesn't always see what you see**

"If you rent a building or cityscape, try to do it exactly! Buildings seem straight to us when we look at them, so make sure the camera "sees" them the same way! - warns Gardiner. Professional advice is especially useful if you're going to travel around the world by attaching a camera to the car's bumper. After all, in the old districts of Amsterdam or London buildings are often tilted.

Gardiner advises to add Kandalama Hotel in Sri Lanka to the list of mandatory places to visit if you like to explore places where the artificial environment meets nature.

"This long construction by Jeffrey Bawa is built on a mountain slope and is completely covered with dense vegetation, which allows you to create frames on which the boundary between architecture and nature is blurred," - explains Gardiner.
